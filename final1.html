	<h2>What is the Internet of Things?</h2>
		<p class="clearFloat">The "Internet of Things" (IoT) is a collection of "smart" devices that are sending data through the 
		internet to other people and devices.  People or devices that recieve that data then interpret it to create an action.  
		Sometimes that data can be simple as "if it's 7am, turn on the coffee maker.", or as complex as a sensor measuring the 
		structural integrity of a bridge.  Examples of IoT devices for consumers include the Amazon Alexa and Dash Buttons, 
		Nest Thermostats and doorbells, Phillips Hue light bulbs, and many more.  </p>

	<h3>"Smart" Devices</h3>
		<p class="clearFloat">There has been a rapid increase in the number of "smart" devices that can be connected to the internet.  
		A "smart" device is just an object that can send data to the internet.  
		With broadband internet becoming cheaper and available in more areas, in the near future, if a device can be connected to the internet, 
		then it probably will be.    
		A device that can simply say if it is "on" can provide meaningful data to who needs to know it.  A garage door opener that can alert 
		the homeowner that it is "on" can be useful information if that homeowner isn't home.  Over the past few years, the data that smart 
		devices can provide has grown richer, and more detailed.</p>

	<h3>Sensors</h3>
		<p>Recently, sensor technology has become more powerful, cheaper to produce, and small enough 
		to intergrate into everyday devices.  With these sensors retrieving valuable data from the environment around it, 
		the possibilities of what IoT is now capable of is endless.  Now, for example, a sensor can detect that it is about to rain, so then 
		an action is sent to a device that will turn off a homeower's sprinkler system.  Or, a sensor inside a home detects movement, so it alerts 
		the homeowner and activates an IoT camera to start recording.</p>

	<h3>The Next Industrial Revolution</h3>	
		<p>Today, most IoT devices are sold to consumers.  However, many industries are taking advantage of the data that 
		IoT can provide.  Sensors, and the data they collect, help industries to improve efficiency, improve customer service, and automate as 
		many processes as they can.  Utilizing this technology in this way is being called the Industrial Internet of Things, or IIoT.	
		Some analyists predict IIoT technology will optimize and streamline so many business and manufacturing processes 
		that IIoT will usher in a new Industrial Revolution, nicknamed the <i>Industrial Revolution 4.0</i>.</p>
		
				
	<h3><a href="pages/final3.html">IoT and Security</a></h3>
		<p>Anything connected to the internet is hackable.  
		As the number of IoT devices continues to grow, security issues are becoming a great concern.  
		Consumer IoT devices, like baby monitors, are becoming more popular over the past few years.  Wi-fi capable baby monitors can connect 
		to the parents' Wi-fi, so a parent can look in on their child from anywhere.  Unfortunately, there have been many 
		<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2018/12/20/nest-cam-baby-monitor-hacked-kidnap-threat-came-device-parents-say/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.87c90c7bd831" target="blank">
		reports</a> of these baby monitors being hacked into, and then used to spy on the family, or leave creepy messages.  Securing these devices, 
		and teaching people how to secure their networks is becoming increasingly important as the IoT market continues to grow.</p>
