	<h2 id="IoTSecurity">IoT and Security</h2>
		<p>All these connected devices is creating a big security problem.  IoT is still in its infancy stage, and industry standards for 
		how these devices connect to the internet and secure the data that they upload hasn't been agreed upon yet.  This is 
		making it difficult for people to protect their devices, and their data.  	
		One data point might not reveal a whole lot.  Having a light turn on at 3am might not mean much, but add in a few more data 
		points from a wearable device that tracks not only your heart rate, but also your exercise route and sleeping habits, then 
		a company, or some nefarious person, could develop a pretty good picture on the person who uploaded that data.</p>

		<p>With all these devices connected to the internet, it becomes even more important to make sure passwords and security protocols 
		are being followed.  The best advice when setting up a new device that can connect to the internet is to change any manufacturer 
		username and passwords that are supplied to set up the device to Wi-fi.  Most people do not change these "admin" settings, and it is these 
		settings that hackers take advantage of to gain control of these devices.</p>

		<p>One dramatic <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/mirai-botnet-minecraft-scam-brought-down-the-internet/" target="blank">case</a>
		happened in 2016, when 3 college students managed to commandeer unsecured IoT devices throughout the world, and used them to launch 
		a targeted distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack that slowed or stopped the internet in France and the eastern United States.  
		These college students took advantage of people not changing the default factory security settings, managed to infect 
		roughly 600,000 devices, and then used those devices to launch their attacks.  
		Luckily, the students' goal wasn't to cripple the Internet, or anything else too criminal.  
		Their main focus was a cut-throat competition to gain subscribers for their Minecraft server.</p>

		<p>HP reseachers had <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2881942/of-10-iot-connected-home-security-systems-tested-100-are-full-of-security-fail.html" target="blank">tested</a> 
		10 IoT home security systems for how secure those systems were.  Of those 10 devices they tested, 
		all 10 had security problems.  One researcher had stated that with one of these systems the homeowner may not be 
		the only one monitoring the home.  The HP researchers found:</p>
	
			<ul>
				<li>100% allowed the use of weak passwords</li>
				<li>100% lacked an account lockout mechanism that would prevent automation attacks</li>
				<li>100% were vulnerable to account harvesting, allowing attackers to guess login credentials and gain access</li>
				<li>4 of 7 systems that had cameras, gave the owner the ability to grant video access to additional users,
				further excerbating account harvesting issues</li>
				<li>Two of the systems allowed video to be streamed locally without authentication</li>
				<li>A single system offered two-factor authentication</li>
			</ul>
		
		<p>In 2014, a <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/2844283/peeping-into-73-000-unsecured-security-cameras-thanks-to-default-passwords.html" target="blank">website</a>, 
		with a Russian IP address, exposed the security issue of failing to changing the default username and 
		password that comes with IoT home security cameras.  The website showed more than 72,000 cameras, live streaming, from 
		256 countries around the world.  The top 10 counties the website listed in 2014:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>11,046 in the U.S.</li>
				<li>6,536 in South Korea</li>
				<li>4,770 in China</li>
				<li>3,359 in Mexico</li>
				<li>3,285 in France</li>
				<li>2,870 in Italy</li>
				<li>2,422 in the U.K.</li>
				<li>2,268 in the Netherlands</li>
				<li>2,220 in Colombia</li>
				<li>1,970 in India</li>
			</ol>

		<p>The number of IoT devices is exploding.  It is expected 20 to 30 billion IoT devices will be connected to the 
		internet by 2020.  This has prompted lawmakers 
		to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cyber-congress/u-s-senators-to-introduce-bill-to-secure-internet-of-things-idUSKBN1AH474" target="blank">find ways</a>
		to ensure that the publics' privacy and data are protected.  As the number of IoT devices continues to grow exponentially, 
		the need for security standards for IoT devices will grow even faster.</p>
